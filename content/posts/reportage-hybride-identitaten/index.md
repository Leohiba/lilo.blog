#### **What i had to do**

Using GIS (Geographic Information Sytems) I analysed the availability of public spaces in
Langenthal. I collected the survey data on my phone and then integrated them into my map for a
better understanding of the situation. As the data I collected were mere points on the map, I had
to chart out the areas correspondingly.

#### Finding Sources


During research I found the following sources for my project.
Proximity to public green spaces was defined as self-reported walking time (either less or greater
than 15 min) from individuals’ homes to the nearest public green space. **(Busisiwe Shezi and
Hilbert Mendoza, 2024)** This gave me the basis for my Project, 15 min are approximately 400m by
foot. For bigger public spaces, of communal size, I doubled the walking distance to 800m.
Well-designed and maintained streets and open public spaces can help lower rates of crime and
violence, make space for formal and informal economic activities, and avail services and
opportunities to a diversity of users; particularly for the most marginalized, where public space
is ‘the poor man’s living room’ and important for recreation, social, cultural and economic
development. (UN Habitat, 2018)

#### Explaining the context


While looking at this map (Fig. 1) we must consider Langenthal’s size and population. It has an
Area of 21,13km², 16,077 Inhabitants and 761 Inh. per km². (Wikipedia, 2024)

#### Conclusion


As we can see, Langenthal has three small public spaces in the city center and two larger ones
on the outskirts. However, these spaces are unevenly distributed and fail to reach a few
neighbourhoods, leaving residents in some areas without accessible public spaces.
I would suggest that the city places several more, smaller public spaces throughout the city, for
people and communities to interact with each other. This would benefit everyone’s sense of
cohesion in the community and improve the overall mental health of residents
